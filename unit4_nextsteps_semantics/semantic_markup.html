<!--
  SEMANTIC MARKUP

  - relating to meaning
  - what purpose or role does that HTML element have?
  - sometimes there are <div>'s that have different names like <main>
  - HTML5 adds markup's that actually mean something, but are still just <div>'s
  <section> is a div that describes it better so you can read what it is
  - Google has crawlers that can figure out what your content is
