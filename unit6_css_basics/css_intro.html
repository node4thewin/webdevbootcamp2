  What is it?
    - CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - how they are arranged and styled.
  
  What does it stand for?
    - CSS stands for Cascading Syle Sheets. We'll cover the "cascading" part in a bit; don't worry about it for now!
  
  There's a lot!
    - CSS is very easy to get the hang of, but it can be intimidating because of how many properties we can manipulate.

  CSS RULES
    - (almost) everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern:

    selecter {
      property: value;
    }
