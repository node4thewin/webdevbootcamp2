# Box Model

In a document, each element is represented as a rectangular box. In CSS, each of these rectangular boxes is described using the standard 'box model'. Each box has four edges:

  1. margin edge (farthest from the element itself)
  2. border edge
  3. padding edge
  4. content edge (closest to the element)

When you inspect elements in Google Chrome, you can see that every element has a box representation to it showing those four edges.
