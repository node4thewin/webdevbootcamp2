<!-- 
  CREATING FORMS
  - The <form> element itself is a shell or container that doesn't have any visual impact.
  - We then fill the form with a collection of inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc.
  
  <form>
    - the form element "represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information."
    - The 'action' attribute specifies WHERE the form data should be sent, essentially this is the server you want to send the piece of information to.
    - The method attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used (don't worry about this for now)

  <input>
    - most common 'form control'
    - the input element is used to create a variety of different form controls
    - there are 20+ possible types of inputs, ranging from date pickers to checkboxes
    - the 'type' attribute is where the magic happens. changing 'type' dramatically alters the input's behavior and appearance.
