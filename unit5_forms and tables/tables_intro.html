  WHAT ARE TABLES?
  Tables are structured sets of data, made up of rows and columns. They can be a great way of displaying data clearly.

  EARLY USAGE
  In the early days of the web, tables were commonly used to create page layouts. Today, you should only use the table element when you are creating an actual data table.

  LOTS OF ELEMENTS!
  To create a table, you'll use 5-10 different elements! It can be tricky to try to remember them all, but don't panic!

  EXAMPLES:
  <table>
  <td>
  <tr>
  <th>
  <thead>
  <tbody>
  <tfoot>
  <colgroup>
  <caption>

  <table> <!-- there are three elements to focus on right now, tr, td, th -->
    <tr> <!-- tr is what groups <td>s in a row -->
      <th>animal</th>
      <th>average mass [kg(lb)]</th>
      <th>maximum mass [kg(lb)]</th>
      <th>flighted</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ostrich</td>
      <td>104(230)</td>
      <td>156(346)</td>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>somali ostrich</td>
      <td>90(200)</td>
      <td>130(287)</td>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
